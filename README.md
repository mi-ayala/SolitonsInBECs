## Abstract
We provide a framework for turning a numerical simulation of a gap soliton in the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation into a formal mathematical proof of its existence. These nonlinear localized solutions play a central role in understanding Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We reformulate the problem of proving their existence as the search for homoclinic orbits in a dynamical system. We then apply computer-assisted proof techniques to obtain verifiable conditions under which a numerically approximated trajectory corresponds to a true homoclinic orbit. This work also presents the first examples of computer-assisted proofs of gap solitons in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on non-perturbative parameter regimes.
