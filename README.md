## Abstract
We rigorously prove the existence of gap solitons in the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation with a periodic potential. These nonlinear localized solutions emerge in spectral gaps and play a crucial role in understanding Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). To prove them, we reformulate the problem as the search for homoclinic orbits in a higher-dimensional dynamical system. We then use computer-assisted proof techniques, combined with a functional analytic framework, to rigorously validate numerically approximated homoclinic orbits. This work bridges computational evidence and formal mathematical proofs, providing a solid foundation for the study of  solitons in the GP equation.
